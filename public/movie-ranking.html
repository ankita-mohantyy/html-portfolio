<h1>ANKITA'S FAVOURITE MOVIES</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
<p>This movie is a masterpiece as it put stress on the rat race of kids nowadays.It beautifully explains that each person is built differently and should not be compared. It is definitely a must watch</p>
<h3>Sita Ramam</h3>
<p>First of all it is a romantic movie and the cherry on the top is it being based on a soldier's life. Even the casting and story telling is just awesome.  </p>
<h3>Hanu-Man</h3>
<p>Hanu-Man basically has a blend of comedy and emotions.This movie will be proved very interesting for the mythology lovers.Its cinematography is a perfect treat to the eyes</p>
